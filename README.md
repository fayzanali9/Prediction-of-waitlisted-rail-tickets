# Prediction-of-waitlisted-rail-tickets
Millions of people use indian railway system each day.
A large fraction of them are unable to get confirmed tickets before their travel.
Tickets get sold out after very short period of opening of booking window.
In our project a user is required to input data according to the different status of their waitlisted ticket with respect to different number of days.
Here we train different machine learning models to get a classification whether a ticket will get confirmed or not.
The aim of the project is tell the user whether to wait or cancel their waitlisted ticket before time to get as much refund as possible.
